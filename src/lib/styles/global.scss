// The idea behind this system is to have a single minified CSS file that is
// generated from this file that includes all the common styles that make
// up the website. Typography, buttons, forms, etc. Anything that is shared
// across pages. The philosophy here is to have a single source of truth for
// all HTML across the site. One should simply have to put "h1" to get the 
// correct header styles, or <div class="button"></div> to get a button.
// This allows for rapid page development as well as rapid style changes as
// one can piece together HTML like lego, and change the entire site from
// a handful of SCSS stylesheets in this folder. No JS, no isolated styles,
// nothing complicated with all full powers of CSS.
